There is a custom user model included that will provide the functionality to switch from a username based login
to an email address based login. There are two files included, admin_email.py and models_email.py. Delete or rename the
origional admin.py and model.py and then rename admin_email.py and models_email.py to admin.py and model.py respectively.
