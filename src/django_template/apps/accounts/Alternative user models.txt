There are two alternative user models provided:

One will allow a case insensitive username to be used whilst also maintaining the casing the user
origionally types in a field called "display_name".

The other will require an email to login, the username field has been kept as a required field.
This can be changed by removing any wording related to username, except for its initial declaration
where you should change "username = None", as the model provided uses django's AbstractUser model
rather than AbstractBaseUser.
